##What is it?
Using the historic Galton Dataset, `shinyapp` is an app that predicts the adult height of a child, if the heights of both of his parents is known.

##How to use it!

You can either write or use the arrows to select the height (in inches) of both father and mother in their respective fields.

Be mindful to put each parent's height in the appropriate field, because it matters in the calculation of the prediction.

Have fun!
